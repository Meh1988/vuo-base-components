    ### About Storybook

    On the left side of the screen, you will see a list of components. They are organized into Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Pages and Templates. You can click on any of them to see the component in action.



    ### What exactly is happening here?

    If you have follower our instructions, you should be running this in a Docker container, alongside a couple of other services. You have just launched three services in your local machine.

    1. [**Storybook**](http://localhost:7703)
    1. [Fix Food Web](http://localhost:7701)
    1. [Fix Food API](http://localhost:7702)

    You can find this page by typing **[localhost:7703](http://localhost:7703)** in your browser, given that Docker is running.

    You are able to stop these services by running `docker-compose down` in your terminal or by going to **Docker Desktop** and stopping the services from there.
